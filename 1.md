#Static Arrays

##Intro

To review, we know that arrays are stored in RAM (Random Access Memory) contiguously as a block of data. But as programmers we think of them as a list of elements (e.g. integers, characters, objects).

There are two main operations we can do with arrays (any most data structures for that matter):

1. Reading data
2. Writing data

##Reading from an Array

In arrays, we use indices (aka indexes) to retrieve values. Under the hood, using indices lets us access memory at a specific address and read the value without us having to know the exact address.

As programmers all we have to know is that:

* `myArray[0]` The 1st value is index 0 (that’s right we start at 0 instead of 1).
* `myArray[1]` The 2nd value is index 1.
* `myArray[2]` The 3rd value is index 2.
etc.

Since our indices are mapped to locations in memory, we can “instantly” read a value. To talk about the efficiency of an algorithm we use something called “Big-O Notation”. We say that “In terms of Big-O time complexity, the efficiency of reading a value at an arbitrary index of an array is O(1)”. 

In terms of Big-O Notation, O(1) is the fastest an operation can get, which is why I’m using the word “instantly”. It’s also considered a “constant time operation” because no matter how big our array gets, the time it takes to read a random value at any index of the array. Because a property of RAM is being able to access any piece of memory without having to search through it. Basically, if we want to read the 3rd value in an array, we don’t have to read the 1st or 2nd values. We will talk more about Big-O Notation later in the course.

In order to read every value from an array all we need to do is read each value 1-by-1. For example, let’s say we call our index, i. We would read the value with `myArr[i]` and increment `i` by 1 to read the next value. This repeats until `i` is equal to the length of the array.

In most languages you can do this with a for-loop or a while-loop:
```javascript
myArray = [1, 2, 3]
i = 0
while (i < myArray.length) {
    myArray[i] // do something with value at index i
    i++
}
```

While this may seem trivial, the ideas we are talking about now are the building blocks for very advanced algorithms we talk about later in the course.

##Writing to an Array

First let’s discuss an important property of static arrays, which is that they are of fixed size. If we have a static array of size 3, and we try to add a 4th value it won’t work. Normally we get an “index out of bounds” error, but even if we didn’t we would be writing to memory which is outside the boundaries of the array. The block of memory after the 3rd value may even be occupied by the operating system. 

On the other hand, if we let the operating system place a 4th value somewhere else in memory, we no longer hold the contiguous property of arrays (which is what allows us to read in O(1) time in the first place).

Basically, we’ve come across a major limitation of static arrays, which is that they are of fixed size. 

Note: Some languages like Python & JavaScript use dynamic arrays instead of static arrays by default, which are not of fixed size. So you may have never even come across this limitation before.

When you declare an array of size 3 for example, even before you write values to it, it will already have some default values. Depending on the language an array of integers may be initialized to all 0s or some other default values.

To add values to this array of size 3 we could do something like:
```javascript
myArray[3] // declare array of size 3
myArray[0] = 5
myArray[1] = 6
myArray[2] = 7
```

We can’t really remove or delete values from a static array, but we can overwrite values to something like 0 if we want to. We always remove values from the end of the array to make sure the “real” values in our array stay contiguous. We accomplish this by keeping track of the next empty spot in the array (this way we can also insert a value in the next empty position).

To keep track of the next empty spot in an array we can store the index of that position. For example, we have a static array of size 3, but we only have 1 “real” value inserted in it (5 which is stored at index 0). So the next empty spot is at index 1 and the “length” of the array is 1. If the next empty position of our array is ever equal to the size of the array (size is equal to the length) then the array is full.

Writing a value to any index of an array is also O(1) time operation (AKA constant time). Similarly, “removing” a value from an array is also O(1) since we are just overwriting the value.

##Writing to Middle

If we wanted to write the first position of our array (index 0) we could do something like `myArray[0] = 4`. But that would overwrite the existing value at index 0. 

To keep the existing elements, we could shift every value to the right by 1 (if there’s an element in the last position it would be overwritten). Then index 0 would be free for us to insert into.

The problem with this is that the number of operations we may have to do is not constant. It actually depends on the number of elements already written to the array. Therefore this is not an O(1) operation. It’s actually a variable time operation, where the variable is the number of elements already inserted. We typically denote this variable with “n”, so we say this is an O(n) time operation.

One last catch is that Big-O time complexity refers to the “worst-case time complexity”. In this context, what is the worst case possible? That the array is full because then we will have to shift every element in the array. So “n” actually refers to the size (i.e. the capacity) of the array, rather than the length. This oversimplification, to always assume the worst case, allows us to more easily compare the efficiency of algorithms without having to know precisely the number of elements inserted into a data structure.


##Removing from Middle

Similarly, we can “remove” values from an array in a simple way by overwriting the value (e.g. `myArray[i] = 0`.

But a more realistic removal at index “i” would be to shift every value to the right of “i” to the left by one, and also decrement the “next empty spot” index that we maintain. This will free up a spot for us to insert into.

Again, in the worst case (if we are removing from index 0) we will have to shift every value to the left by one.


##Static Array - Time Complexities 


| Operation                 | Big-O Time Complexity |
| :---------                | :---------:           |
| Read / Write i-th Element | O(1)                  |
| Insert Middle             | O(1)                  |
| Insert / Remove End       | O(n)                  |
| Remove Middle             | O(n)                  |
